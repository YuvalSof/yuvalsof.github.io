I work at the intersection of data, strategy, and go-to-market. Over the years, I’ve collaborated with strategy, marketing, and revenue operations teams to turn business questions into data, data into insight, and insight into action. My background spans business performance analysis, customer behavior, and market research - often with a focus on the bigger picture behind the numbers, and always with a practical eye on what drives results.

Curious by nature, methodical by habit, I’m drawn to the messy middle where business logic meets market reality.
