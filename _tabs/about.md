I’m a senior business analyst with a proven ability to turn complexity into clarity. My experience spans multiple industries, combining both macro and micro-level market research to support cross-functional teams with analysis that drives real business decisions.

My work often sits at the intersection of revenue operations, strategy, marketing, and analytics. I’ve helped go-to-market and marketing teams uncover growth levers, and track the metrics that actually matter. Whether it’s improving retention, modeling ROI, or surfacing the “why” behind performance trends - I focus on insight that’s actionable, not just accurate.

I bring curiosity, structure, and perspective to every project. And I believe the best analytics doesn’t just answer questions - it helps ask better ones.
