##  Welcome

You're not here for pipelines. You're here for **perspective**.

This blog explores:
- Real-world data quirks that confuse even the sharpest AutoML engines
- Manual feature engineering backed by domain knowledge
- The intersection of machine intelligence and human understanding
- Business-driven modeling over leaderboard-chasing

If you’ve ever whispered *“but that doesn’t make sense…”* while staring at a SHAP plot, you’re in the right place.
